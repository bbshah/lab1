	<p>I fundamentally believe that if you are not learning new things, you stop doing great and useful things. With that said, I'm a newly minted (self-taught) front-end developer and designer with a strong marketing background. Previously, I worked for a startup incubator and a mobile ad startup. I concurrently work at General Assembly in the intersection of technology and education, where my focus is on fostering and developing learning opportunities for women and minorities to learn how to code. My work was recently featured in aUSC Alumni Profile.Some of my writings aboutdigital marketingandL.A. techare featured on theGeneral Assembly blog.</p>
